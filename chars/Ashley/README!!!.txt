Ashley is a witch and a young girl who has come from a game called WarioWare
She has an assistant named Red which he is for whatever reason, 
Ashley's acomplice. Her personality can be strict and fierce sometimes
but mostly calm. In one of the games, she failed to make a potion and walked
out with misery. Suddenly, encountering a white alien thingy....she knew that he was the missing ingredient.
So now she tries to catch him.
;----------------------------------------------------------------------
In Mugen 1.0, she was made by her specials as flames, and some specials
are also something else. She has assists not only from the original mario game
but from warioware. She also has this custom assist where she summons goombas
and a DK Barrel. For the hypers there's one that she has the ability to stop time. 
Finally, for the taunt its replaced with a powercharge.
Anyway, here are the list of specials and hypers.
