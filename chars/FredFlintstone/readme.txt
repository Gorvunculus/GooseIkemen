Fred Update by aperson98 original by Warner
---------------------

 Hey folks anyone found warner original version of this character a bit of a crappy spriteswap?  I hope this update fixes that as well as polishing the gameplay on him
 A new intro and victory were added with none other then Freds buddy Barney rubble.  I also got rid of Fred's hurricane kick and Shroyuken speicals to make hime play less like 
a poor mans shoto clone, I also make Freds Monster hand super hittable after the hand pops up as well as making his club a special move rather then just a standard move.
