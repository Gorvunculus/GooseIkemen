Kirby
From Kirby's Dreamland / Super Smash Bros.
Version 1.11
For M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and above
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Note
==========================================================================================
This character was made with only single and turns mode in mind, so using this in simul mode is probably not a good idea.

 +Hitting the opponent with the Ultra Burst will launch them upward and will be unable to recover from it

To do list
==========================================================================================
- Fix bugs and errors that I might have missed
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Introduction
==========================================================================================
This Kirby uses a custom gameplay style. He is based on a hypothetical moveset for what Kirby would be like if he were a playable character in Blazblue Cross Tag Battle. This read me will explain how this gameplay style works. His move list can be found in the .pngs included in this folder. 
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Default Button Layout
==========================================================================================
A, B, and C: Attack Buttons

X: Rapid Cancel

Y: Dodge

Z: Grab
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Gameplay Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Double Jump (Tap Up in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty self explanatory, allows you to jump a second time in the air. Can be canceled into after connecting any of your air normals. Can only be used once in the air, can't be used if you have already air dashed. Kirby can air jump twice before touching the ground

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Dash (Double Tap Forward/Back while in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sends you flying forward or back for a set distance. Can be canceled into after connecting any of your air normals. Can only be used once in the air, can't be used if you have already used both air jumps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dodge (Y)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a very short amount of time, you'll become invulnerable and can pass through the opponent and their projectiles. Just pressing Y will keep you stationary, pressing Y and forward at the same time will have you move forward a short distance, and pressing Y and back will have you back dash. The stationary dodge can also be done in the air. You will become vulnerable again near the end of the dodge animation, so be carful about how you time it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grab (Z)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again, pretty self explanatory. Overrides the opponent's guard, but only works if they're not in the air and not in a hit state

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Grab (Z in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inversely, only works on airborne opponents and can work even when they're in a hit state. Can be used as a combo ender.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running Grab (Z While Running)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Works on airborne opponents and standing opponents even when they're in a hit state. However, it won't work on crouching opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid Cancel (X When your attack has made contact with the opponent) (Costs 1000 meter) (Costs 500 meter if used during a Distortion Drive)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will immediately put you in a neutral state, this can be used to extend combos, make otherwise unsafe moves safe, or make you more unpredictable to your opponent. Holding Forward or back while inputing the command will immediately have you run or back dash respectively (Air Dash Forward/Back when in the air), Holding up will immediately make you jump, and holding down while in the air will quickly bring you back to the ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Angle Attack (Press Forward and X or Forward and B+C While guarding) (Costs 1000 meter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancels your guard animation into an invulnerable attack animation that sends the opponent flying backward. Deals damage, but doesn't kill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burst (y+z while getting hit) (Can only be used once per round) (Doesn't work if you're being thrown or being hit by a super)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploys a non damaging blast around your character that sends you opponent flying away from you. A poorly timed burst can leave open for even more damage, so be carful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake up Action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wake up animation can be canceled into a forward dodge or a back dash. In Kirby's case, he can also cancel into Final Cutter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter hit bonus
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All attacks will deal bonus damage and increased hit stun in some cases if they hit the opponent while they're attacking

==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Character Specific Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy Abilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Kirby uses inhale or super inhale on the opponent, He will gain a different set of moves mapped to the B button depending on who he inhaled. However, if Kirby gets hit by a super move or an attack that deals at least 130 damage, he will lose his copy ability. You can check CopyAbilities.png to see what each Copy Ability can do. If you want to make a certain character compatible with this feature, see Copy Compatibility How To.txt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mix
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This force break will start a roulette that will give a specified copy ability once it stops. While it may seem completely random at first, the roulette will always roll in the same order starting from the current copy ability. If you can get the timing down, it's possible to get the exact copy ability that you want.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guard Break
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hammer Flip is capable of breaking the opponent's guard, causing them to stagger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Guard
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as Kirby stays in his stone form after using 5C or jC, he will auto guard against all attacks. He will still be vulnerable to grabs though.

==========================================================================================
Copy Ability Specific Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ice: Freeze
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Ice Breath or Ice Sprinkle on a projectile will freeze it. All that Kirby has to do is move into the frozen projectile, and it will be pushed towards the opponent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plasma: Charge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Depending on how much charge Kirby has (indicated by the electricity surrounding him), Plasma Shot will become more powerful. Kirby can use kinetic charge (Mashing directional inputs at any given time) or static charge to increase his charge, the charge will slowly decrease if Kirby isn't doing either of these. Both static and kinetic charge can be used at the same time for faster charging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hammer: Counter Hit Properties
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hammer Nail and Giant Swing will bounce the opponent into the air on counter hit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spear: Tipper
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spear Thrust will deal more damage and hit stun if it hits the opponent at the tip of the spear.
