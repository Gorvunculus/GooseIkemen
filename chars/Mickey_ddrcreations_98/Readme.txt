    I'd like to add that with out the brilliant work of these creators, certain aspects of my characters would probably not be as refined:

    BB Hood's Push Blocking which is copied exactly and, the AI activation and guard modes are, I believe his. (http://a-and-f.mainpage.net)
   
    Splode. Well I'd like to say that it was Splodes Rouge which got my started developing for Mugen. In fact my first attempts at creating a character for Mugen used Rouge as a template. 
   
    Well, thanks again BBHood!

Please guys, make sure no one uses my sprites without consent from me. It would really hurt my future releases.
Bug and ridiculous infinite reports please! Also, if you like my characters-- Donate--- on my site, thanks. Any motivation is much appreciated!
